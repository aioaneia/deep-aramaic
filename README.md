Ancient History relies on disciplines such as Epigraphy, the study of ancient inscribed texts, for evidence of the recorded past. However, these inscriptions are often damaged and illegible parts of the text must be restored by specialists.

This work presents a novel method for providing letter classification using deep neural networks and synthetic data generation.
